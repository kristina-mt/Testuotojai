Summary

Functional: test
The testing conducted insert feature/module meets requirement to enter the data.
Button's "All", "active", "Completed" and "Clear" function meets the requirement.
Count of "items left" doesn't meet requirements (defected).
Double-click meets the requirement. Function works to edit "To Do List" item.
Console reports: 
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (3 times)
// reference to learn.json:1, api:1 and favicon.icon#/:1



Non-functional:
Text box looks like more boxes are open due to poor design.
Active button missing capital letter. 

// :) HTML
	<!-- THIS IS A STUPID APP AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHY WE'RE WASTING OUR TIME DOING THIS DEV WORK -->


Recommendation

1. Improve design.
2. Correct JS code to count "items left" increase result by 1
3. Correct spelling "active" to change first letter to capital letter.
